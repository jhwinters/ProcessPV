This is just a small utility (written in Ruby) and a few shell scripts to
enable data from Fronius PV inverters to be logged and then sent to
pvoutput.org for display.

It relies on the Fslurp utility, written by David Stone and available for
download from Sourceforge.

http://fslurp.sourceforge.net/

The scripts are designed to be run on a small Linux box.  I use a SheevaPlug
running Debian Squeeze, but it seems an obvious job for a RaspberryPi when
the rush dies down.

You can install the scripts where you like, although /usr/local/bin seems
an obvious place.  You also need to set up a couple of cron jobs, and a
sample cron file is provided.  You can change the intervals to suit yourself,
but I find those given work well.
