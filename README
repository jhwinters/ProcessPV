This is just a small utility (written in Ruby) and a few shell scripts to
enable data from Fronius PV inverters to be logged and then sent to
pvoutput.org for display.

It relies on the Fslurp utility, written by David Stone and available for
download from Sourceforge.

http://fslurp.sourceforge.net/

The scripts are designed to be run on a small Linux box.  I use a SheevaPlug
running Debian Squeeze, but it seems an obvious job for a RaspberryPi when
the rush dies down.

The scripts assume that the binaries (in the bin directory) will be installed
in /usr/local/bin and the config file (in the etc directory) will be
installed in /usr/local/etc.  Changing this is trivial, but is up to you.
You also need to edit the config file to set your system id and key (from
pvoutput.org) and to indicate where you want the log files stored.
